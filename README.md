📘 Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains my implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) written in C.
It serves as a personal learning project to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts and improve problem-solving skills.

🚀 Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

Build a strong foundation in data structures and algorithmic thinking

Practice efficient coding and logical problem solving

Prepare for technical interviews and competitive programming


Each program is written in C, with clean code, meaningful comments, and simple examples for clarity.
